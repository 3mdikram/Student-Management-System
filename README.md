# Student-Management-System

In this project, there are two types of login. i.e Admin and User. After Logging in as a user, he/she can View students, units, courses, attendance records,
marks and academic year.
Admin has full control of the system, admin can view/add students, units, course, academic year and maintain student’s attendance records.
And also from the admin settings, he/she can view current groups and add new groups, members as well as edit anonymous permissions. 
All the data records can also be viewed from the admin’s setting and some other features are view/rebuild fields, 
import a CSV file to database and batch transfer of the ownership. 
The system can also create file backups for further purposes.
